# opencode-muse

An [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) plugin that lets OpenCode (and therefore
[OpenChamber](https://openchamber.dev/)) use a Muse Code subscription with
auth and inference staying entirely inside the official Muse Code CLI
(`muse serve`, via `@muse-code/sdk`).

No subscription credential is ever extracted, cached, or injected into
OpenCode — unlike
[opencode-muse-auth](https://github.com/TheStreamCode/opencode-muse-auth), the
credential-extraction approach under review in that repo's
[issue #12](https://github.com/TheStreamCode/opencode-muse-auth/issues/12).

## Status

Design v1.3 and the implementation/TDD plans are approved. Implementation has
started with the compatibility gates; see the
[v1 tracking issue](https://github.com/pgarciaq/opencode-muse/issues/2) for
current progress. Muse lifecycle/media and OpenChamber UI probes remain gates
before the features that depend on them.
